# Void Box (`/dev/voidbox`)

> Terminal screenshoot of VoidBox demonstration.

## Problem Solved

The [**Char Device Driver** Training](./2025-12-20-linux-module-http-router.md) is realy eye opener for me. At first, I'm totally blind, i know nothing how to "listen" when a user interact with the `/dev/voidbox`, thanks to [lwn.net](https://lwn.net/Kernel/LDD3/) for the *Linux Device Drivers, Third Edition* Book, it helps me a lot.

In the screenshoot, i throw an "I/O Error", when the user rewrite to the `voidbox`, i didn't allow it and i did it on purpose for the clarity.

And for the `mutex` i enable a simple `mutex_lock` and `mutex_unlock` method, I think it's enough for a simple kernel module and for a training challenge.
